            <h3>Cedar Grove, FL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Cedar Grove is an unincorporated area and census-designated place in Bay County, Florida, United States. It was formerly an incorporated town, but it was dissolved in 2008 after a vote by residents. The town had 90 days from October 3, 2008, to implement the dissolution ordinance and hand over all operations to organs of the county government. This was the first time in Florida history that a town was disincorporated by a vote of its citizens. The dissolution ordinance took effect at 8:00 AM on October 22, 2008, at which time the police department was disbanded and all assets became the property of the Bay County Commission. The current census-designated place had a population of 3,397 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Panama City–Lynn Haven–Panama City Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area.</p>
