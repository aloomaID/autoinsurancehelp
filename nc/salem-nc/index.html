                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The town of Salem was originally designed as a Moravian settlement by Frederick William von Marschall in 1772 as part of the Wachovia Tract. The Moravians had previously bought this 99,000 acre plot of land from Lord Granville in 1753. At first, von Marschall sold the plots of land only to Moravians, which led to some conflict. The restrictions were slowly lifted, and by 1856 the Moravian church ended the lease system.</p>
