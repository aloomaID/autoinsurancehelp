            <p>In 1770, Squire John Flemming, who later was a Revolutionary War soldier, purchased about 1650 acres situated between Bald Eagle Creek and the West branch of the Susquehanna River encompassing much of present day Lock Haven and Flemington (named after the family). The Flemings built a large house on the bank of the river close to the southern abutment of a nearby dam and it could be seen from the highway between Flemington and Lock Haven.</p>
